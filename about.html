	<p>Sit back and let me take you on a journey. Some may skim this, and that‚Äôs okay‚Äîbut context matters. My story is the foundation of the unforgettable experience I want to create for you. <strong>Here we go!</strong></p>
	<p>My passion for music began in a small city tucked away in Pennsylvania‚Äôs Allegheny Mountains‚Äîspecifically, in the passenger seat of my mom‚Äôs car. This was the cassette tape era, and she had a deep love for classic rock‚ÄîDavid Bowie, Alice Cooper, The Cars, The Rolling Stones. Most of the time, instead of the radio, it was her cassettes that played everywhere we went.</p>
	<p>One of her favorite stories to tell? When I was barely able to talk, I was in the back seat belting out the lyrics to <i>Red, Red Wine</i> by UB40 on the way home from the babysitter‚Äôs house. So yeah, you could say my love for music started early.</p>
	<p>As I got older, my taste expanded‚Äîhip-hop, rap, and electronic music started pulling me in. The energy of raves and underground parties fascinated me‚Äînot just the music, but the raw, unfiltered human connection that came with them.</p>
	<p>It was in hearing about those parties that the seeds of DJing were planted. Legends like Franky Bones, John Digweed, and Carl Cox inspired me in the early days, while deadmau5, Infected Mushroom, and Daft Punk kept the fire burning in the 2000s. The idea of becoming a DJ stuck with me‚Äîand once it took hold, I couldn‚Äôt shake it.</p>
	
	<h2><i>‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt remember the songs you played, they remember how you made them feel.‚Äù ‚Äì Carl Cox</i></h2>

	<h3>THE 2010s‚ÄîWHERE IT ALL BEGAN</h3>

	</figure>
	
	<p>In 2009, I left my small town in the middle of Pennsylvania and moved to Pittsburgh with no car, two restaurant jobs, and a determination to make it work. By 2011, I landed my first job in IT, and through that, I discovered raves, underground parties, and the thriving electronic music scene here in Pittsburgh.</p>
	<p>Then in 2015, everything changed. I attended my first EDM show in Washington, D.C., to see the DJ duo Dada Life‚Äîand it was nothing short of epic. It wasn‚Äôt just about the music; the entire experience was next-level. From the high-energy beats to the unexpected pillow fights (perfectly fitting their track Happy Violence), it was pure, controlled chaos.</p>
	<p>That night lit a fire in me. It wasn‚Äôt enough to just enjoy the music‚ÄîI wanted to create those moments. I started crafting mixes and playlists, channeling that same electrifying energy into my own sound. Fast forward to today, and that passion still fuels everything I do. Whether it's a club night, festival, or private event, my goal is simple: to make every set an unforgettable experience.</p>

	<h3>TODAY & BEYOND</h3>

	<p>Since 2019, I‚Äôve been DJing in clubs and streaming live on Twitch, bringing a unique set of skills that go beyond just playing music‚ÄîI create memorable, immersive experiences. That‚Äôs why I offer recording and livestreaming as part of my packages. If someone important can‚Äôt make it to your event, a livestream or recording ensures they can still be part of your special day, no matter where they are.</p>
	<p>Beyond live events, I‚Äôve been deeply involved in the music community:</p>
	<p>üéß Since 2022, I‚Äôve helped manage EDC Discord Music Night LIVE, a monthly livestream showcasing DJ sets from the EDC Discord community. I help curate, broadcast, and host these sets on Twitch, ensuring each show reaches fans worldwide.</p>
	<p>üì° Since 2023, I‚Äôve been a monthly resident DJ on Ibiza Stardust Radio‚Äîthe world‚Äôs largest dedicated house music radio station, based in Spain.</p>
	<p>üé∂ In January 2025, I attended the Pittsburgh DJ Summit and its workshops and . At the conference, I connected with fellow DJs, industry professionals, and music enthusiasts to continue pushing my craft forward. Events like this are key to staying ahead of trends, learning from the best, and bringing fresh ideas and techniques to the decks.</p>
	<p>üî• Starting March 2025, I‚Äôll also be a monthly resident on MSYH.FM Radio out of Pittsburgh, where I showcase my high-energy drum & bass side (not for the faint of heart).</p>
	<p>But enough about me‚Äî<strong>what does this mean for you?</strong> It means you're getting a DJ with global experience, technical expertise, and a passion for making your event truly unforgettable.</p>

	<h3>MORE THAN JUST MUSIC‚ÄîAN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE</h3>

	<p>Your DJ‚Äôs experience‚Äîboth in life and music‚Äîmatters. The way your event feels, the energy on your dancefloor, and the way your music is presented can make all the difference.</p>
	<p>Just like Dada Life gave me an unforgettable night on that D.C. dancefloor, I want YOU to have those same lasting memories. Whether it‚Äôs your wedding, a milestone event, or a party, once cocktail hour, dinner, and formalities are done‚Äîit‚Äôs time to turn up. Let‚Äôs get that dancefloor moving and create a night you‚Äôll still be talking about a decade from now.</p>
	<p>With years of livestreaming experience on Twitch, I‚Äôve mastered mixing across all genres, seamlessly blending everything from EDM, rock, and hip-hop to country, Latin, R&B, and even hair metal. Whatever your vibe, I‚Äôve got you covered. Let me take you on a journey through your favorite sounds in a way you‚Äôve never heard before.</p>
	<p>Beyond DJing, my background in livestreaming and technology has made me an expert in professional video and audio editing‚Äîbecause if you‚Äôre putting on an epic event, you should have a way to relive it. That‚Äôs exactly why I started this company: to bridge the gap between the traditional DJ experience and today‚Äôs cutting-edge technology.</p>
	<p>So let‚Äôs make your big day unforgettable‚Äîand share it with the world.</p>
