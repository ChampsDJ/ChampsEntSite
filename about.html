	<h3>MY STORY</h3>
	
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> Since 2019, I’ve been DJing in clubs and streaming live on Twitch, bringing a unique set of skills that go beyond just playing music. I create memorable, immersive experiences, both virtually and in real life.</p>
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> Since 2022, I’ve helped manage EDC Discord Music Night LIVE, a monthly livestream showcasing DJ sets from the EDC Discord community. I help curate, broadcast, and host these sets on Twitch, ensuring each show reaches fans worldwide.</p>
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> Starting in June 2024 and running for 12 legendary episodes, I was a monthly resident DJ on Ibiza Stardust Radio, the world’s largest dedicated house music radio station, based in Ibiza, Spain.</p>
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> Since October 2024, I have been a regular at Pittsburgh Open Decks events at various venues across the city including Spirit, Bottlerocket, and Jackworth Ginger Beer, further honing my skills on club-standard equipment and continuing to play out live in front of audiences.</p>
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> In 2023, I began offering private event and wedding entertainment services. I have booked over a dozen events & weddings in that time, growing in my journey as an entertainer, an MC, and in service to my clients.</p>
	<p><i class="fas fa-caret-right" style="color: #C8A700;"></i> In 2025 & 2026, I attended the Pittsburgh DJ Summit; a two-day DJ conference with presentations and workshops given by some of the best wedding and event DJs from all across the country. I networked with fellow DJs and event industry professionals to continue pushing my craft forward.</p>

	<h3>ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES</h3>
	
	<h2><i>“People don’t remember the songs you played, they remember how you made them feel.” – Carl Cox</i></h2>
	
	<p>Can I let you in on a secret? When you hire someone to soundtrack your event, you're not just booking entertainment, you're designing the feeling of the most important day of your life. I understand that.</p>
	<p>When potential clients reach out to me, they usually start by asking about music, which makes sense, music is what people tend to think about when thinking about a DJ.
	<p>But, what you're really investing is goes far beyond a playlist. You're investing in how your day <i>flows</i>, how it <i>feels</i> when guests arrive, how <i>smoothly</i> moments transition, & how <i>confident</i> you feel knowing someone is guiding everything behind the scenes.</p>
	<p>My role isn't just to play songs, it's to create an entertainment experience that supports every moment of your wedding or event. From the first guest walking into the room, until the last song of the night, we will keep the vibes and energy high.</p>
	
	<h2>AN EXPERIENCE BUILT AROUND YOUR VIBE</h2>
	
	<h2><i>"A DJ is there to give people what they want. You have to feel what the crowd wants and do your best to provide it for them." – Steve Aoki</i></h2>
	
	<p>Every event has a rhythm and vibe, it's my job to protect it.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I won't just be dropping tracks, I will be:</p>
	<ul class="left-aligned-list">
		<li>Reading the room and adjusting to the energy of the crowd in real time</li>
		<li>Knowing when to step forward on the mic</li>
		<li>Making announcements that feel natural, not forced</li>
		<li>Ensuring audio is clean, clear, and reliable for vows, speeches and dancing</li>
		<li>Using lighting to enhance the space, not distract from it</li>
		<li>Keeping your timeline moving without it ever feeling rushed</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When this is all done right, no one notices <i>how</i> it’s happening. They just feel like everything flows effortlessly. This is what we strive for at my company.</p>
	
	<h2>A PLANNING & TEAM-FIRST APPROACH</h2>
	
	<h2><i>"The DJ booth is not a place for personal taste, it’s where you take people on a journey." – Fatboy Slim</i></h2>
	
	<p>I don’t believe in cookie-cutter weddings.</p>
	<p>Before we ever talk about music genres or lighting options, I want to understand:</p>
	
	<ul class="left-aligned-list">
		<li>What kind of atmosphere you want your guests to feel</li>
		<li>Which moments & formalities matter most to you</li>
		<li>How you envision the energy changing throughout the night</li>
		<li>What you want to avoid just as much as what you want included</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Our conversations will feel less like boring meetings and more like exciting planning sessions because that’s exactly what they are. By the time your big day arrives, the hard work has already been done, and it is time to enjoy yourself.</p>
	<p>Another thing that I will do on-site is ensure that all of your other vendors are on the same page as us by communicating clearly and sharing our timeline with them so that everyone is on the same page.</p>
	
	<h2>CALM, PROFESSIONAL, PREPARED</h2>
	
		<h2><i>"I try to DJ like I'm playing a live instrument. I try to bring the energy and excitement of playing an instrument to what I do as a DJ." – Mix Master Mike</i></h2>
	
	<p>Your wedding day should feel exciting, not stressful.</p>
	<p>I pride myself on being the steady presence clients can rely on. Someone who shows up prepared, communicates clearly, and adapts quickly when plans change.</p>
	<p>When you book me, you're gaining a partner on your day who cares deeply about how that day unfolds and how it's remembered for years to come.</p>
	
	<h2>LET'S DESIGN YOUR CELEBRATION!</h2>
	
	<p>If you're looking for more than just background music; more than an ego-centric DJ who thinks they are headlining Coachella. If you want an intentional, well-executed entertainment experience, <a href="contact.html">I'd love to talk.</a></p>
	<p>Let's focus on the flow, the feeling, and the moments your guests will still be talking about long after the last track plays!</p>
